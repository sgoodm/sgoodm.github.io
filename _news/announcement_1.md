It's been more than a few years since I last updated my personal website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Previously I was using [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), but it felt like time for a refresh, and an opportunity to support an active project.

After some searching I settled on [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).
