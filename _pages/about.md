I am a research scientist and data engineer at [AidData](https://aiddata.org), a research lab based out of the Global Research Institute at William & Mary.  My work involves improving the accessibility of geospatial data, as well as designing and operationalizing novel research methods which leverage geospatial data, machine learning, and distributed computing.  I received a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering at Villanova University, and a Ph.D. in Computational Geography at William & Mary.

<!--
Across my work I focus on well-designed software, replicable research, and scalable approaches. Examples of my work include:

- GeoQuery:
Seth developed GeoQuery, AidData’s free spatial data platform, which enables individuals and organizations without significant computing power or data science expertise to freely find and aggregate satellite, economic, health, conflict, and other geospatial data into a single, simple-to-use spreadsheet file.


My recent research has focused on the use of machine learning approaches ranging from random forests to convolutional neural networks to estimate sparse development indicators such as poverty and non-permissive environments.


He is also currently working in partnership with the Cloudera Foundation to transition AidData's geospatial data processing infrastructure from a traditional High Performance Computing environment to an Apache Hadoop and Spark based stack.

In addition, Seth provides talks and trainings for a range of audiences which have included the NetHope Summit, the World Bank, the French Development Agency as well as numerous other development agencies and academic conferences. -->
