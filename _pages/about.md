I am a research scientist and data engineer at AidData, a research lab based out of the Global Research Institute at William & Mary. My work involves improving the accessibility of geospatial data, as well as designing and operationalizing novel research methods which leverage geospatial data, machine learning, and distributed computing. I received a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering at Villanova University, and a Ph.D. in Computational Geography at William & Mary.
