Seth Goodman is a data engineer at AidData, a research lab based out of the Global Research Institude at William & Mary. He specializes in designing and operationalizing novel research methods focused on the use of geospatial data, machine learning, and high performance computing. Seth developed GeoQuery, AidData’s free spatial data platform, which enables individuals and organizations without significant computing power or data science expertise to freely find and aggregate satellite, economic, health, conflict, and other geospatial data into a single, simple-to-use spreadsheet file.

Seth's current research is focused on the use of convolutional neural networks and satellite imagery to predict sparse development indicators such as poverty and non-permissive environments. He is also currently working in partnership with the Cloudera Foundation to transition AidData's geospatial data processing infrastructure from a traditional High Performance Computing environment to an Apache Hadoop and Spark based stack.

In addition, Seth regularly travels to provide talks and trainings for a range of audiences including the NetHope Summit, the World Bank, the French Development Agency as well as numerous other development agencies and academic conferences. Seth completed his BS and MS in Electrical Engineering at Villanova University, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computational Geography at William & Mary.
